      <h2> My Life Story</h2>
<p> Hi, I'm Steve, the curator of Steve's Spledid recipes! I Love to code but I also Love to cook.
  I was born In the North East portion of the United States. I moved to Nashville to get away from it all. I
  have a wife and she is also a Software Engineer, boy do I love my family! Dont you? I mean we are so awsome!
  My daughters are my children that I have they look just like me, so beautiful! we all love to go on walks in the sunset
  I took one of those walks that we love just last week and that is what inspired me to share this wonderful recipe with you today.
  but before I share that with you I would first like to share why I love cooking.
</p>
<p> 
  <h3>1. It’s fun.</h3>

  I love that cooking give me a chance to be creative and indulge in some ‘play’ time – something we adults could do with a lot more. I adore losing myself in the rituals of chopping, stirring and tasting.
  
  <h3>2. It’s delicious.</h3>
  
  When you’re cooking you get to choose what you make AND what goes into each dish. You also get to choose the quality of the ingredients. So it’s easy to make things that are the most delicious to you.
  
  Love chilli (like I do)? Then add more. Love sharp, acidic flavours (like I do)? Then add a splash of vinegar or a squeeze of lemon.
  
  Think of it as a choose your own (tasty) adventure.
  
  <h3>3. It’s good for your body.</h3>
  
  The more I learn about nutrition the more I’ve come to realize that the most important factor for healthy eating is to avoid processed food and focus on using real ingredients.
  
  And the best way to do this? Cook for yourself as much as you can.
  
  <h3>4. It’s good for the soul.</h3>
  
  Spending 30 minutes in the kitchen preparing dinner will put me in a much calmer, less frazzled mood than sitting on the couch for the same amount of time.
  
  Plus it gives me an opportunity to nurture my family and friends. To express my love and take care of them.
  
  <h3>5. The praise!</h3>
  
  As much as I’d like to think that all these lofty benefits were what first got me into cooking, really, it was the praise.
  
  Hearing the words ‘this is amazing’ was a huge motivator for me to keep spending time in the kitchen when I was learning to cook.
  
  And still is.
  <h3>6. It helps me code better</h3>
  <p> Before I became the Awsome cook you see before you today, I used to eat McDonalds and that is not the growth mindset. I had to learn to cook to code better. better
    better brain better code, its just that simple.
  </p>
</p>
<p> Oh wait, where was I? Oh yeah, the Recipe, I was at a park near my home when I saw a large deer galloping through the woods and I thought to my self
  I havent had stroganoff in a while. then it dawned on me, <a href="https://midwestniceblog.com/venison-stroganoff-recipe/">Venison Stroganoff</a> how Unique!
  how Bold! How Tasty! How do i make it? I scowered the internet for HOURS! ans still nothing, so I came up with my own 
  strategy for stroganoff
