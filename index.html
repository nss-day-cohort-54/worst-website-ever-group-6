    <h2> My Life Story</h2>
    <p> Hi, I'm Steve, the curator of Steve's Splendid recipes! I Love to code but I also Love to cook.
      I was born In the North East portion of the United States. I moved to Nashville to get away from it all. I
      have a wife and she is also a Software Engineer, boy do I love my family! Dont you? I mean we are so awsome!
      My daughters are my children that I have they look just like me, so beautiful! we all love to go on walks in the
      sunset
      I took one of those walks that we love just last week and that is what inspired me to share this wonderful recipe
      with you today.
      but before I share that with you I would first like to share why I love cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>1. It’s fun.</h3>

    I love that cooking give me a chance to be creative and indulge in some ‘play’ time – something we adults could do
    with a lot more. I adore losing myself in the rituals of chopping, stirring and tasting.

    <h3>2. It’s delicious.</h3>

    When you’re cooking you get to choose what you make AND what goes into each dish. You also get to choose the quality
    of the ingredients. So it’s easy to make things that are the most delicious to you.

    Love chilli (like I do)? Then add more. Love sharp, acidic flavours (like I do)? Then add a splash of vinegar or a
    squeeze of lemon.

    Think of it as a choose your own (tasty) adventure.

    <h3>3. It’s good for your body.</h3>

    The more I learn about nutrition the more I’ve come to realize that the most important factor for healthy eating is
    to avoid processed food and focus on using real ingredients.

    And the best way to do this? Cook for yourself as much as you can.

    <h3>4. It’s good for the soul.</h3>

    Spending 30 minutes in the kitchen preparing dinner will put me in a much calmer, less frazzled mood than sitting on
    the couch for the same amount of time.

    Plus it gives me an opportunity to nurture my family and friends. To express my love and take care of them.

    <h3>5. The praise!</h3>

    As much as I’d like to think that all these lofty benefits were what first got me into cooking, really, it was the
    praise.

    Hearing the words ‘this is amazing’ was a huge motivator for me to keep spending time in the kitchen when I was
    learning to cook.
   
    <h3>6. It helps me code better</h3>
    
    <p> Before I became the Awsome cook you see before you today, I used to eat McDonalds and that is not the growth
      mindset. I had to learn to cook to code better. better
      better brain better code, its just that simple.

      <h3>Tips and substituions:</h3>
      <li> Mushrooms - I like to use sliced baby portabella mushrooms, though button would work too. If you’re allergic
        to
        mushrooms or simply don’t like them, they can be left out.</li>
      <li>Beer - The flavor that a roasty, toasty brown ale offers this stroganoff recipe is divine. But if you don’t
        enjoy cooking with beer or can’t find a quality craft brew, simply use an equal amount of beef stock.</li>
      <li>Beef - While stroganoff is traditionally made with chunks of tender beef roast, it is so delicious with ground
        venison. And! Subsequently, suitable for ground beef as well! So, if you don’t have access to ground venison,
        feel
        free to substitute ground beef in this recipe. </li>
      <li>Dairy - I like the mixture of using heavy cream and sour cream in this recipe. Though, again, substitutions
        can
        be made. Using all heavy cream will result in the thinner sauce. Using all sour cream will result in a thicker
        sauce that is very tangy. I have made it both ways and enjoy both! Use what you have on hand!</li>
      <li>Noodles - Egg noodles are the traditional noodle used when serving stroganoff. They’re mild flavored, tender,
        and their shape provides the perfect surface for sauce. This would be just as delicious served over rice or a
        bed
        of mashed potatoes.</li>
      <li>To serve and store - Keep the noodles and meat separate until serving, as the noodles can become soggy and
        break
        down if mixed together. Store separately in the fridge. When reheating, add another splash of heavy cream or
        milk
        to the sauce to bring it back to life when reheating.</li>
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>8 oz. Portabella Mushrooms sliced</li>
      <li>1 medium White Onion diced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon Minced Garlic</li>
      <li> 2 pounds Ground Venison</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon corn starch</li>
      <li>8 oz. Brown Ale (or similar style beer)</li>
      <li>16 oz. Beef Stock</li>
      <li>8 oz. Sour Cream </li>
      <li>8 oz. Heavy Cream </li>
      <li>Fresh Parsley, for serving (optional)</li>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <p>
      <ul> Step 1: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet. Add mushrooms, season with 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook until
        mushrooms
        have released their juices and are brown, about 6-8 minutes.</ul>
      </ul>Step 2: Remove mushrooms from pan and add another 2 tablespoon oil to pan. Stir in onion and cook until
      onions begin to
      become translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the
      vension, seasoning generously with kosher salt, and cook until browned through, about 10 minutes.</ul>
      </ul> Step 3: Sprinkle the cornstarch over the browned meat, stirring to coat and break up any large chunks,
      ensuring the
      meat is evenly coated. Deglaze the pan with the brown ale, scraping any browned bits off the bottom. Taste and add
      more salt, if necessary.</ul>
      </ul> Step 4:Add the beef stock. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce to simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until
      liquid has
      reduced by half.</ul>
      </ul> Step 5: Stir in sour cream, heavy cream, and cooked mushrooms. Cook until bubbly and thick. Serve over warm
      egg noodles
      and top with freshly chopped parsley, if desired.</ul>
